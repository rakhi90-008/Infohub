Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Backend:
   cd InfoHub-Challenge/server
   npm install
   # add your OpenWeather API key in .env (OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key)
   npm run dev
   Backend runs at http://localhost:3001

2. Frontend:
   cd InfoHub-Challenge/client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   Open the Vite URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- The client package.json contains a proxy to forward /api requests to the backend in development.
- For production, build the client (npm run build) and serve the build from any static host or from Express.
